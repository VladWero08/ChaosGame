# Chaos-Game
This project implements the chaos game using R and its package shiny for User Interface. One of the most interesting fractals arises from what Michael Barnsley has dubbed `The Chaos Game'. Depending on the shape chosen by the user, the fractal will be completed by applying a function with multiple parameters

## Chaos function
The user will be able to complete multiple fields in the inteface, which correspond with function parameters:

* **ratio** between the current and the next point
* **speed** of completing the fractal
* **number of points** to be drawn

By playing with the chaos ratio, the fractal generated will significantly change. 
These are some of the fractals that can be generated using the script:
